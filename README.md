### DATAMIND: Roadbuilder 3: Investigating severe mental health and physical illness across the four nations

Datamind is a collaborative project aiming to enrich mental health data science in the UK. I am working on RoadBuilder 3, which seeks to catalogue the routine data resources available in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland for studying severe mental illness and physical health. Resources will be made available to researchers on the HDR_UK website, in the form of a catalogue of data sources and code lists which will be available on the [HDR-UK phenotype library](https://phenotypes.healthdatagateway.org/).

We will be testing the feasibility of studying cardiovascular disease risk factors in people with severe mental illness across a range of data sources. 

I'll up load code here as the project begins. [Read more about Datamind here!](https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/helping-with-health-data/health-data-research-hubs/datamind/)
